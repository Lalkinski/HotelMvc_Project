# HotelMvc_Project
Project Overview

This project represents a simple Hotel Management Application developed as part of a course. The main idea of the application is to manage hotel reservations, guests, and rooms in a structured way. The system is intentionally kept simple, as its purpose is to be improved and expanded in future courses.

The Reservations page displays all guests who have made a reservation. On this page, it is possible to see the room number, the check-in date, the check-out date, and the number of guests staying in the room. Each reservation includes a Details button, as well as a Create Reservation button. When the Create Reservation button is clicked, a form appears that allows the creation of a new reservation. When a new reservation is created, a new guest and a new room are automatically created as part of the process.

When accessing the Reservation Details page, detailed information about the selected guest is displayed. This page shows all reservations made by the guest, the room number, and the reservation type. There are four reservation types available, and each type determines how many people the room can accommodate. The page also displays the number of nights, as well as the check-in and check-out dates. At the bottom of the page, there are two navigation buttons. The All Reservations button redirects back to the main reservations page, while the Hotel Room button opens the details page of the specific room, accessed by its room number. From the room page, it is also possible to create a new reservation.

The Guests page displays a list of all guests, including their email addresses, phone numbers, and the number of reservations each guest has made. When selecting the Details option for a guest, the same detailed reservation information is shown as in the Reservation Details section.

The Rooms page shows all hotel rooms in the system. For each room, the application displays the room number, the room type, and whether the room is marked as valid, although no specific validation logic is implemented yet. From this page, it is possible to access the related guest or open the room individually through the View Room button. Inside the Room Details page, a full description is shown, including check-in and check-out information, the most recent reservation, guest email, number of guests, and whether the room is currently available.

Overall, the application is intentionally simple and includes limited functionality. The goal of the project is to serve as a foundation that will be improved and expanded in future development courses.
